  /**
   * Handles incoming WhatsApp messages and decides the appropriate action.
   * This can include parsing commands, replying to direct mentions or messages, or sending responses through the ChatGPT AI.
   *
   * The function first checks for the type of message and whether it qualifies for a response based on certain criteria,
   * such as being a broadcast message, a direct mention, or containing a specific command.
   *
   * If the message includes a recognized command, the function dispatches the message for command-specific handling.
   * Otherwise, it constructs a prompt for the ChatGPT AI based on recent chat messages and sends a response back to the user.
   *
   * The function supports special actions like generating images or synthesizing speech based on the content of the message.
   *
   * Parameters:
   * - message: The incoming Message object from the WhatsApp Web.js library that encapsulates all data and operations relevant to the received WhatsApp message.
   *
   * Returns:
   * - A promise that resolves to a boolean value indicating whether a response was successfully sent back to the user or not.
